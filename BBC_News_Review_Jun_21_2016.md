## BBC World Service Report

The US government Accountability Office says it is concerned that many federal activities, including the country's nuclear arsenal, urgently needed to upgrade outdated technologies.

It said Pentagon systems helping to coordinate the strategic deterrent, such as intercountinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers rely on 40-year-old computers and floppy disks.

You may have thought the floppy disk was now a historical artefact. But it turns out it is alive and well within the US Defence Department and used to store data in the system that communicates with the different parts of America's nuclear deterrent.

The 1970's technology is so limited that you need about 3 million of them to approach the storage capacity of a $10 USB memory stick.

But the Pentagon is not alone. US social security systems are written in a computer language dating from the late 1950s which fewer and fewer people are familiar with.

On the floppy disks, the Pentagon says they will be gone by the end of next year though the 40-year-old computers that use the, may take a little longer to reach the museum.
